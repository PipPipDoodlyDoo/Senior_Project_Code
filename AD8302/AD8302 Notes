For the Evaluation board, The top pins from left to right are:
    1: Ground
    2: Vpp
    3: Ground

There are also rings that are Ground and Vpp

TYPICAL RATING:
    Power Supply: 5V
    Input Voltage: -73      to -13 dBm
                    140 uV  to  140 mV
Test 1:
	This test was conducted within the SPL using:
		RIGOL DG1022	Function Generator
		RIGOL DP832		Programmable DC Power Supply
		RIGOL DM3058E 	Digital Multimeter
		RG316 Wires (1 meter)
		BNC-to-SMA Adapters
		AD8302
		
	Function Generator Parameters:
		For both OUTPUTS
			Freq:			20 MHz
			Ampl:			14 mVpp -> -33 dBm
			Offset:			N/A
		Phase (Output 1):	0 degree
		Phase (Output 2):	varied from 0-to-360 degrees
		
    Equations:
        Converting the Votlage to phase offset [Volts-to-Degree]
        y = 94.476x - 177.44
        y = -94.786x + 177.15

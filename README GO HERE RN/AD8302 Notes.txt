For the Evaluation board, The top pins from left to right are:
    1: Ground
    2: Vpp
    3: Ground

There are also rings that are Ground and Vpp

TYPICAL RATING:
    Power Supply: 5V
    Input Voltage: -73      to -13 dBm
                    140 uV  to  140 mV

From testing in SPL we have the functions (degree offset):
    Lower Half (-180 -> 0):
        y = 0.0106x + 1.878
    Upper Half (0 -> 180):
        y = -0.0105x + 1.8685

    As we can see
